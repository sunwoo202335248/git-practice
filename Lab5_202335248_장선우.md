I/O Redirection
 Standard Output: By default, output is to the screen. Use '>' to redirect output to
a file, creating or overwriting the file. Example: ls > output.txt.
 Appending Output: Use '>>' to append output to an existing file, or create a
new file if it doesn't exist. Example: ls >> output.txt.
 Standard Input: By default, input is from the keyboard. Use '<' to redirect input
from a file. Commands can be mixed with output redirections, for example, sort <
input.txt > output.txt.


Pipelines
 Usage: Allows chaining commands by feeding the output of one command as the
input to another using the '|' symbol. Example: ls | grep "txt".
 Exiting View: Use the 'q' key to exit from viewing output in some command
interfaces.

 CLI-Based Editors: You can use editors like Vim or Nano. If there's a problem
with Nano on Windows, other text editors like Notepad can be used as
alternatives.


Shell Scripting
 Creating Scripts: Write and execute shell scripts. For handling issues in Windows
with Nano, alternative text editors may be used.
 History: Use the 'history' command to view previous commands or save them to
a file with history > history.txt


Downloading and Data Management
 wget: Download files directly to your active directory using 'wget [URL]'.
 curl: Useful for fetching, uploading, and managing data over the Internet with
'curl [options] [URL]'.

 grep: Search within files using regular expressions. Example: grep "search_term"
file.txt finds all occurrences of "search_term".
 '-i': Case-insensitive search.
 '-v': Invert the match.
 '-n': Display line numbers with matches.
 '-r': Recursive search.
