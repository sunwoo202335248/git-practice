Changes vs. Snapshots.
Changes: storing data as changes to the base version.
Snapshots: Storing data as snapshot
Local : Managing file versions on personal computers.
Centralized : Managing files from a central server for all users.
Distributed : Each user has their own local repository, allowing synchronization with a central
server.

Three States in Git
Modified: Files have been changed but not yet staged.
Staged : Files are marked to be committed.
Committed : Changes are safely stored in the repository

Ignore a file
# ignore all .a files (*.a)
# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above (!lib.a)
# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdit/TODO (/TODO)
# ignore all files in any directory named build (build/)
# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt (doc/*.txt)
# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory an any of its subdirectories
